## How to test on a physical device

2. Once that is enabled, Go to `system > developer options` on your phone, and turn on USB debugging
3. Plug the phone to your computer with a USB cable. If you get a prompt on your phone that says whether to allow USB debugging with this computer, click yes
4. `cd client`
5. Run `flutter run` as usual, and it should automatically run on your physical device. If not, click on device name in the bottom bar on vsCode and change it to the name of your physical device.
