<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a UBC LaunchPad Project where a team of 12 developers, 3 designers, a team lead, and a stakeholder worked over an 8 month period to build the application from start to finish. 

EpiLog is a mHealth seizure tracking app for people with epilepsy and their carers. Epilepsy requires consistent monitoring for effective treatment. This application is to consolidate epilepsy management into one place and is easily shared with others.
